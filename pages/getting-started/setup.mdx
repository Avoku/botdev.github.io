You can download the bot from [here](https://polymart.org/resource/discord-ranked-bot.3636).

## Local Setup

1. Create a folder on your desktop.
2. Move the bot jar file into the folder.
3. Inside the folder, create a text file and name it "run".
4. Open the text file and paste the following inside:

```batch
:: If your compiled bot jar has a different name, make sure to change it accordingly.
java -jar RankedBot.jar
pause
```

5. Rename the text file and change its file extension to `.bat`, so it should look like `run.bat`.

When you run the file, it will create all the necessary folders and files, such as those for fonts, themes, databases, etc.

If you encounter an error or see a message in the terminal window indicating that there is no token in the config.yml file, you need to obtain the token from the Discord Developer Portal.

## Bot Setup

Now that you have set up the bot on your local machine, you need to obtain a token from the Discord Developer Portal.

### Developer Portal

5. Click on "Reset Token" to generate a new token.
6. Copy the bot's token and paste it in your `config.yml` file.

```yml
# Bot's token
token: PASTE_TOKEN_HERE
```

7. Scroll down to "Privileged Gateway Intents", and enable all three options.

### Inviting the bot

1. In the sidebar, click on the "OAuth2" section.
2. Scroll down to "OAuth2 URL Generator", and check the "bot" box.
