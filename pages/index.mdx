# Introduction

Discord Ranked Bot is an advanced Discord bot that can be used on any server for various purposes. It was originally designed for Ranked Bedwars but can be utilized in other ways as well.

The bot is open-source, so you can make edits as long as they comply with the license. The documentation is open-source too, so the community can correct any mistakes or update outdated information.
